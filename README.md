# Image-recognition

Project Description:
This project guides participants through building an image recognition model in Python
using deep learning. Over five days, students learn fundamental concepts and practical
skills in image classification, culminating in a deployable, portfolio-ready toolkit
showcasing their expertise in computer vision.

What is This Project About?
The bootcamp is designed to transform beginners into skilled AI practitioners by
teaching them how to preprocess images, train convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
and build an image recognition system using Python and popular libraries like
TensorFlow/Keras. Participants develop hands-on experience with essential machine
learning workflows, deepen their understanding of model evaluation, and create
professional portfolio assetsâ€”preparing them for high-paying roles in data science and
computer vision.

Learning Outcomes & Skills Developed:
Image preprocessing and augmentation
Deep learning fundamentals and CNN architecture
Model training, evaluation, and optimization
Visualization of results and metrics
Collaboration and documentation best practices
Showcasing ML projects for recruiters

What You Have to Do (Step-by-Step):
Preprocess and Explore Your Dataset
Download a free image dataset (e.g., MNIST, Cats vs. Dogs, CIFAR-10 from Kaggle);
normalize, resize, and visualize sample images using Python and OpenCV.
Build & Train Your First CNN Model
Implement a basic convolutional neural network using TensorFlow/Keras in Google
Colab, train it on your dataset, and monitor accuracy/loss metrics.
Enhance with Data Augmentation & Model Evaluation
Apply image augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping) and evaluate your model 
using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. 
Visualize
your results using Matplotlib.
