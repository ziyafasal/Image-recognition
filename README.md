# Image-recognition

Project Description:
This project guides participants through building an image recognition model in Python
using deep learning. Over five days, students learn fundamental concepts and practical
skills in image classification, culminating in a deployable, portfolio-ready toolkit
showcasing their expertise in computer vision.

What is This Project About?
The bootcamp is designed to transform beginners into skilled AI practitioners by
teaching them how to preprocess images, train convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
and build an image recognition system using Python and popular libraries like
TensorFlow/Keras. Participants develop hands-on experience with essential machine
learning workflows, deepen their understanding of model evaluation, and create
professional portfolio assetsâ€”preparing them for high-paying roles in data science and
computer vision.

Learning Outcomes & Skills Developed:
Image preprocessing and augmentation
Deep learning fundamentals and CNN architecture
Model training, evaluation, and optimization
Visualization of results and metrics
Collaboration and documentation best practices
Showcasing ML projects for recruiters
